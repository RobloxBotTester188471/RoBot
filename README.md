# The most basic bot in existance for Roblox.

RoBot is a bot that uses a Roblox client and can perform actions automatically.
It uses `pygetwindow` to focus on Roblox and send keypresses to it.

Since it only uses keypresses, RoBot does **not** require administrator privileges or
require you to enter credentials.
